1.  scoring: (query vector, key vector) -\> scalar, for all key vectors (keys primed by query)
2.  attention weights: distribution over scores, obtained by softmax
3.  attention pooling: weighted average of values (by attention weights)

scoring options:

-   additive: w1_t tanh(W2_t q W3_t k)

-   scaled dot product:

additive:

```{python}
class AdditiveAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, key_size, query_size, num_hiddens, dropout, **kwargs):
        super(AdditiveAttention, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.W_k = nn.Linear(key_size, num_hiddens, bias=False)
        self.W_q = nn.Linear(query_size, num_hiddens, bias=False)
        self.w_v = nn.Linear(num_hiddens, 1, bias=False)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)

    def forward(self, queries, keys, values, valid_lens):
        queries, keys = self.W_q(queries), self.W_k(keys)
        # After dimension expansion, shape of `queries`: (`batch_size`, no. of
        # queries, 1, `num_hiddens`) and shape of `keys`: (`batch_size`, 1,
        # no. of key-value pairs, `num_hiddens`). Sum them up with
        # broadcasting
        features = queries.unsqueeze(2) + keys.unsqueeze(1)
        features = torch.tanh(features)
        # There is only one output of `self.w_v`, so we remove the last
        # one-dimensional entry from the shape. Shape of `scores`:
        # (`batch_size`, no. of queries, no. of key-value pairs)
        scores = self.w_v(features).squeeze(-1)
        self.attention_weights = masked_softmax(scores, valid_lens)
        # Shape of `values`: (`batch_size`, no. of key-value pairs, value
        # dimension)
        return torch.bmm(self.dropout(self.attention_weights), values)

```

scaled dot product:

```{python}
class DotProductAttention(nn.Module):
    """Scaled dot product attention."""
    def __init__(self, dropout, **kwargs):
        super(DotProductAttention, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)

    # Shape of `queries`: (`batch_size`, no. of queries, `d`)
    # Shape of `keys`: (`batch_size`, no. of key-value pairs, `d`)
    # Shape of `values`: (`batch_size`, no. of key-value pairs, value
    # dimension)
    # Shape of `valid_lens`: (`batch_size`,) or (`batch_size`, no. of queries)
    def forward(self, queries, keys, values, valid_lens=None):
        d = queries.shape[-1]
        # Set `transpose_b=True` to swap the last two dimensions of `keys`
        scores = torch.bmm(queries, keys.transpose(1,2)) / math.sqrt(d)
        self.attention_weights = masked_softmax(scores, valid_lens)
        return torch.bmm(self.dropout(self.attention_weights), values)

```
